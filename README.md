# Computational Models of Neurons

This repostiory provides implementation of computational models simulating *biological* neurons. More specifically, you can find

1. An implementation of the integrate-and-fire model for single neurons when injecting current.
2. An implementation of the integrate-and-fire model for two neurons connected by two synapses in the excitatory and inhibitory case.
3. An implementation of the famous Nobel prize model by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952).
